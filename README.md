# Radar-wisdom-of-crowds

This repository contains the data and code required to perform the analysis in the manuscript: "The wisdom of crowds emerges in flocks of thousands of migrating songbirds" by Joe Morford, Patrick J. Lewin, Joe Wynn, Maria C.T.D. Belotti, Richard P. Mann, Christopher Krupenye, & Dora Biro. 

The code for the main analysis is in "radar_analysis_GitHub.R" and for the additional analysis on bird observations is in "eBird_analysis_GitHub.R". 

The original dataset of radar detections is also available online: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Swallow_and_martin_roosts_detected_on_WSR_in_the_Great_Lakes_region_from_2000_to_2020/20137961/2?file=51071105. The ERA5-Land surface wind dataset is publicly available upon request from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. The citizen science bird observations are publicly available upon request from the eBird database maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (eBird Basic Dataset. Version: EBD_relJan-2025. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York. Jan 2025.).
